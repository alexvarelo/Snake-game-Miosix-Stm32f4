Implementation of the snake game with the STM32 micro-controller running with the Miosix kernel.

For this project, the tools and media used are:

-Virtual machine that runs Ubuntu 18.04
-Qstlink2 in Windows for sending the .bin file to the board
-Miosix kernel installed on the virtual machine
-STM32f407 discovery board
-USB to TTL Serial Cable

With this tools I was capable of doing a customizable version of the snake game,
running in a terminal in a Linux machine with the TTL wire, writing the 'screen /dev/ttyusb0 19200' command,
and interactive with the 'w a s d' keys for moving the snake.
